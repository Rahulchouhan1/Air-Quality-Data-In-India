# **India Air Quality Analysis (2015-2024) 🚀**  

This project analyzes air quality trends in India from **2015 to 2024** using **pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. The dataset contains **pollution levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3)** for various cities, allowing for in-depth time-series analysis, seasonal trends, and the impact of key events like **Diwali and COVID-19 lockdowns**.  

## **Features & Analysis**  
✅ Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ AQI Trends by Year, Month, and City  
✅ Correlation Between Pollutants  
✅ Seasonal & Festival-based Air Quality Impact  
✅ Lockdown Effect on Air Pollution  

## **Dataset**  
- **Source:** CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board), India  
- **Time Period:** 2015 - 2024  
- **Data Fields:** City, Date, AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, etc.  

## **Results & Insights**  
📌 **Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata** have some of the highest AQI levels.  
📌 **Winter months (Nov-Jan)** see the worst air quality, while **monsoons (Jul-Sep)** improve it.  
📌 **COVID-19 lockdown (March-May 2020)** led to a **sharp AQI drop** in major cities.  
📌 **PM2.5 and PM10** are the biggest contributors to air pollution.
